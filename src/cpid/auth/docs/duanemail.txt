OK - then what I propose is that you make a simple userland program  
that takes commands through stdin and outputs through stdout, and  
we'll connect it to the Flash player through a pipe using popen().

something like:

[d/e]:[keypair index]:[cipher]:[hexdigits]\n

responds with:

[hexdigits]\n

For instance, encoding

e:3:DES:DEADFACEBEEFCAFE <- command
96A7637413FE5A9F <- response

...decoding...

d:3:DES:96A7637413FE5A9F <- command
DEADFACEBEEFCAFE <- response

By using stdio, this makes it easy to test/debug.  You'd pad missing  
hex digits necessary to get a full block with zeros.
